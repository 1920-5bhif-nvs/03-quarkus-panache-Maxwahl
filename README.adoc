== About

This exercise is basically a refactoring of Exercise 1, as the model used will be the same.
However, the code will be more streamlined as the first iteration implemented a lot of unused code.

== Model

=== CLD
[plantuml]
----
Item "1" o-- "n" Exemplar
Person "1" o-- "n" Loan
Exemplar "n" o--o "m" Loan
class Item {
    + id : Long
    + name : String
    + genre : String
    + price : double
}
class Book extends Item {
    + id : Long
    + name : String
    + genre : String
    + price : double
}
class CD extends Item{
    + id : Long
    + name : String
    + genre : String

}

    + id: Long
    + person: Person
    + exemplars: List<Exemplar>

}
enum Weariness {
    undamaged,
    used,
    heavilyUsed,
    unusable

----
Description: The library has Exemplars of different Items ( CDs or Books in stock). A Person can make Loan containing various Exemplars.

== Use Cases
[plantuml]
----

actor customer as "Customer"
actor librarian as "Librarian"

usecase UC1 as "Loan-Statistics"
usecase UC2 as "Inventory-Expansion"
usecase UC3 as "View open Loans"
usecase UC4 as "Self-return of Loan"

librarian --> UC1
librarian --> UC2
librarian --> UC3

customer --> UC4
----
Description:

1. Loan Statistics:
    A librarian wants to know which _Items_ are lend out the most.

2. Inventory-Expansion:
    A librarian wants to add new _Items_ to the Library, and register multiple new _Exemplars_.

3. View open Loans:
    A librarian wants to know which _Loans_ of a specific _Person_ are currently open.

4. Self-return of Loan:
    A customer wants to return a _Loan_ by himself.

=== ReST-API

UC1:

UC2a (Add a new Item):

CD
[source, shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/items -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "Primo Victoria","genre": "Power Metal","price": 10.0,"composer": "Sabaton","runtime": 61.0,"class": "at.htl.library.model.CD"}'

Book
[source, shell]

----

The reason why the _class_ field is needed is because the Endpoint receives _Items_ and Jackson needs this attribute to decide which sublass it needs to deserialize to.

UC2a (Add a new Exemplar):
[source, shell]
----
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/items/exemplar -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"id":4,"class": "at.htl.library.model.CD"}'
----
WARNING: Be sure to use _Item_-ids that exist in your app-run, although, the provided examples work.

The __Item_ has to be added in its minimal form - the id, and for Jackson the class is needed again.

UC3:
[source, shell]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/loans/person/1
----
WARNING: Be sure to use _Person_-ids that exist in your app-run, although, the provided examples work.


The _Person_-id is needed as a PathParam

UC4:
[source, shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/loans/finish -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[{"id": 1},{"id": 5}]'
----

WARNING: Be sure to use _Exemplar_-ids that exist in your app-run, although, the provided examples work.

The _Exemplar_ has to be added in its minimal form - the id

== Panache vs Hibernate

This project includes implementations for both frameworks.

=== PanacheEntity vs PanacheRepository

First of all, deciding on how to use Panache is quite straightforward.

If your projects just needs basic CRUD-operations there is no reason not to use PanacheEntity
(except having inheritance), but if there are some complicated transactions or you want to follow
the familiar Repository/Dao concept, PanacheRepository is just fine.

=== Code vs Queries

The biggest factor when deciding between Hibernate and Panache is certainly the JPQL-affinity of the programmer.
When using Hibernate (JPQL), the programmer basically has the full might of SQL available at his hand. If he so pleases,
he can write extremely complex queries that handle grouping,joining and ordering out of the box.

This also makes the code look more clean, as the "Database-Operation" is self-contained and separated from other code.

PanacheRepositories on the other hand, just feel like simple List/Stream manipulation and therefore are easy to implement
and make "queries" more understandable/readable for "newbie"-programmers.

=== Verdict

In my case, using PanacheRepositories was faster when implementing. This might be related to doing the hard work of
designing the "query" when implementing Hibernate first. However, Panaches injected implementation of basic stuff feels great because you don't
have to write boilerplate code, which is always nice.

But not everything is perfect: There are a lot of missing features which would be great and make Panache SO much better than Hibernate;
Current Documentation is very little and lacks a lot of "new" features.
